## 🔎 User Story
```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## 💡 Usage Instructions
1.	Locate and navigate to the directory that contains the `index.js` file within your editor.
2.	Launch an integrated terminal directly from your editor and execute the command `node index.js`.
3.	Engage with the command-line interface facilitated by npm's inquirer package. Progress through each prompt in sequence, providing responses as required.
4.	Upon successfully completing the prompts, an SVG file named `logo.svg` will be automatically generated.
5.	If desired, you have the option to rename the `logo.svg` file to better align with your preferences.
